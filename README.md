Project Overview
This project utilizes Esper for its lightweight processing capabilities to handle continuous queries on robot trajectories. We've added a spatial-temporal extension to support specific trajectory queries for agricultural robots.

Key Features
Spatial-Temporal Queries: Enhanced to support complex trajectory data, enabling detailed analysis of robot movements within agricultural environments.

Query Support Includes:
- Average Weight Speed: Calculates the average speed weighted by various parameters over time.
- Trajectory Delay: Monitors and reports delays in the trajectory, helping to optimize route planning.
- Speed Trend Analysis: Analyzes trends in speed, assisting in predictive maintenance and efficiency improvements.
- Divergence Checks: Ensures the robots' paths do not diverge from planned routes, maintaining operational accuracy.
- Inside Zone Checks: Verifies whether a robot is within a designated dangerous zone (polygon).
